# win32CRT_producer-consumer
 Multi-threading in windows.  This implementation presents the producer-consumer paradighm.  The construct is utilized when we are receiving many tasks to process, and and we don't enough time to process them.  We don't want to cause lag, we want to confidently keep track of the tasks to maintain order, and we want to ensure completion of all tasks as well as not simply dropping them.  We seperate the processes for seamless collection tasks, and employ seperate worker thread(s) to complete them.
